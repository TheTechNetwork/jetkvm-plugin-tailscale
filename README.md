# Tailscale JetKVM Plugin
This is a plugin for the JetKVM to add Tailscale support. It implements a simple TLS proxy to expose the JetKVM interface to the tailnet as well as a WebRTC TURN server to provide a mechanism to proxy WebRTC traffic through the tailnet without kernel-level TUN device support.
